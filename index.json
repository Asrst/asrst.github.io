You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Math Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file and adding markup: mmark to your page front matter.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $$...$$.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n\\[\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}\\]\nExample inline math $$\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2$$ renders as \\(\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2\\) .\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n\\[f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026 \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026 \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}\\]\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD; A--\u0026gt;B; A--\u0026gt;C; B--\u0026gt;D; C--\u0026gt;D; ```  renders as\ngraph TD; A--\u0026gt;B; A--\u0026gt;C; B--\u0026gt;D; C--\u0026gt;D;  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram participant Alice participant Bob Alice-\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;prevail...
